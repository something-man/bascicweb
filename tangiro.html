        <p> Kamado (Japanese: 竈門 炭治郎, Hepburn: Kamado Tanjirō) is a fictional character and the protagonist of Koyoharu Gotouge's manga Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. Tanjiro goes on a quest to restore the humanity of his sister, Nezuko, who was turned into a demon after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji following an attack that resulted in the death of his other relatives. After an encounter with Giyu Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family. Besides Ufotable's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba anime adaptation, Tanjiro has also appeared in a light novel that acts as a prequel to the manga.

            Gotouge created Tanjiro following a suggestion from their editor of having a bright main character who would stand out in his dark narrative. His design was influenced by Himura Kenshin from Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga Rurouni Kenshin when deciding how androgynous the character should look. The character is primarily voiced by Natsuki Hanae in Japanese and Zach Aguilar in English.
            
            The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his sister while also becoming a strong fighter. This has led to the character winning multiple awards with Hanae's performance as him also receiving one. Aguilar's performance was also well-received.
